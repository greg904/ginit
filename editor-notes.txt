When moving the viewport horizontally, redraw because it's not easy to draw only
what's needed.
When moving the viewport vertically, we can only draw the new lines and shift
the whole content up or down.

How do we redraw the screen?
- We must know the first line in the viewport:
  * We could keep the cursor position relative to the start of the viewport,
    with the cursor's file offset and then go back to find the start line.
  * We could directly store the file offset to the start line of the viewport
    and update it when we move up or down.

Unoptimized first, will rethink later. Try to eliminate number of state first
and prefer recomputing things.

Must work in all conditions, even with very low memory, one of most important
tools!
